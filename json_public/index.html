		<description>Marketing automation helps to target and schedule more efficient event communications. Automations make it possible to schedule messages beforehand and target them to certain audiences based on their participation, behavior, or other data.  This allows the organizer to create automation workflows that make the arrangements easier and more efficient.</description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Arranging an event takes a lot of work and includes a list of things to remember&nbsp;&ndash; whether the occasion is live, online, or as a hybrid, combining both. Especially the needs for communications vary between different event genres. Invitations, tickets, confirmation messages, reminders, and other informative messages &ndash; not to even mention marketing &ndash; there&rsquo;s a lot to remember.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why every event organizer&rsquo;s toolkit should include marketing automation.</p><p>Marketing automation helps to <strong>target</strong> and <strong>schedule</strong> more efficient event communications. Automations make it possible to schedule messages beforehand and target them to certain audiences based on their participation, behavior, or other data.</p><p>This allows the organizer to create automation workflows that make the arrangements easier and more efficient. By using marketing automation, the organizer makes sure that all event data is utilized and visible for the whole organization.</p><p><strong>Let&rsquo;s begin to explore the marketing automation possibilities within event communications.

At its best, a hybrid event can combine the best of both worlds within online and live events, bringing together a broader and maybe even more international audience.</p><p>But how to get there and make sure everything goes smoothly? This is where good event communication steps in. Make sure to communicate in such a way that makes your audience understand the new hybrid event concept and get realistic expectations from it. With hybrid events, it&rsquo;s especially important to target the messaging based on participation type: the online participants don&rsquo;t need to hear from live location arrival instructions and the live participants on the other hand don&rsquo;t get extra value from webinar software advice.</p><p><a href="https://www.eventilla.com/en/arranging-a-webinar-webinar-faq/?utm_source=lianablogEN&amp;utm_medium=lianablogEN&amp;utm_campaign=efficient-event-communications-with-automations" target="_blank">Online events and webinars</a> have entered our lives by the latest during last year. The communications for online events should also be informative. Participants want to know at least the technical requirements of how to follow the event and how to join the fun. Good communications bring added value to the event experience. For example, try handing out some additional materials to support the program.</p><p><img alt="" class="shadow-image" height="1220" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/efficient-event-communications-with-marketing-automation/marketing-automation-in-hybrid-and-online-events-automation-workflow-eng.png" width="1320" /></p><h2><a name="numbertwo"></a>Planning the marketing automation</h2><p>You&rsquo;re probably already familiar with one of the most important principles of marketing: knowing your customer personas. This works as a good starting point for planning the event communications and automation too.</p><p>Who are the ideal participants of your event? What media do they use and read? What are their motivations for participating in the event and what use will they get out of it? These are some of the important questions that should stand at the base of your event communications. <a href="https://www.eventilla.com/en/event-communications-and-marketing/?utm_source=lianablogEN&amp;utm_medium=lianablogEN&amp;utm_campaign=efficient-event-communications-with-automations" target="_blank">Here you&rsquo;ll find more tips for event communications</a>.</p><p>After you&rsquo;ve defined the ideal participant type, you can start to focus on how those persons will end up participating in your event. Have they shown their interest by subscribing to your newsletter or clicking a CTA button? Or have they already taken the beginners&rsquo; version of the same course? These are some questions that guide you in finding the base for the audience you&rsquo;ll want to invite.</p><p>And just like that, you&rsquo;ve now created segments to target the marketing automation messages to.</p><h2><a name="numberthree"></a>How to utilize marketing automation in hybrid and online events</h2><p>Next, we&rsquo;ll walk you through the six steps of how to utilize marketing automation in hybrid and online event communications:</p><ol><li><a href="#1">Event visibility online</a></li><li><a href="#2">Invitations and marketing</a></li><li><a href="#3">Confirmation messages</a></li><li><a href="#4">Reminders and informative messages</a></li><li><a href="#5">Communications during the event</a></li><li><a href="#6">Communications after the event</a></li></ol><p><img alt="" class="shadow-image" height="2352" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/efficient-event-communications-with-marketing-automation/marketing-automation-in-hybrid-and-online-events-infographic-eng-.png" width="1200" /></p><h3><a name="1"></a>1. Event visibility online</h3><p>Digital marketing needs a home base &ndash; a landing page that provides more information for the person browsing online. Create your event a landing page with a registration form. The registration form fields should then collect all the needed participant data safely into one place. Instead of collecting many Excel files or trying to keep up with the registrant count in your head, we recommend using event management software. This will also make sure that all the needed data from special diets to preference questions is collected and possible to anonymize when needed.</p><p><em>Tip! When the registration process is integrated with marketing automation, you can utilize the form field answers and choices when targeting automated messages.</em></p><p>This way the participant data collection is automated and you&rsquo;ll be able to focus on other tasks.</p><h3><a name="2"></a>2.&nbsp;Invitations and marketing</h3><p>As the webinar or hybrid event is held at least partially online, it&rsquo;s only natural to send the invitations digitally. Sending digital invitations is the easiest with email marketing, newsletter, or marketing automation software. This also allows message automation and targeting.</p><p>How to utilize marketing automation when sending out invitations:</p><ul><li><strong>Schedule</strong> the invitations beforehand, to be sent a certain time before the event. Depending on the event&rsquo;s nature, we recommend sending them at least a couple of weeks before. However, sometimes even a save-the-date message that is sent months prior to the event might be needed.</li><li><strong>Target</strong> the invitations to the audience of your choice. With the help of data that is fetched to marketing automation, you can target to&hellip;<ul><li>Participants of all or some of your events</li><li>Earlier participants who have shown interest in the upcoming events by filling out some specific form field when registering</li><li>Those who chose to answer a certain question on your feedback form (try for example: &ldquo;Are you interested in participating in our events in the future?&rdquo;)</li><li>Newsletter subscribers</li><li>List of people who downloaded your website materials</li></ul></li><li>Schedule and target another <strong>reminder</strong> invite for those who haven&rsquo;t yet registered by a certain date and time.</li></ul><h3><a name="3"></a>3.&nbsp;Confirmation message</h3><p>When the participants have registered for an event or bought a ticket, they often expect to receive a confirmation message, stating that the registration has been completed successfully.</p><p>An event management software like <a href="https://www.eventilla.com/en/introduction/features/" target="_blank">Eventilla</a> usually sends out the confirmation messages automatically via email, right after the registration has been made. You can also allow the participant to edit their own participation information with just one click in the confirmation message.</p><p>When it comes to hybrid events, you should always remember to state the participation type in the confirmation message, so that the participant can check whether the ticket is for the online or live event.</p><h3><a name="4"></a>4. Reminders and informative messages</h3><p>Events tend to have many different communication needs, like reminders, informative messages, instructions, or maybe even some inspirational letters. What they all have in common is that it takes time to plan and write the texts and content. Especially in a hurry, it&rsquo;s easy to make mistakes <em>(we all know the frustration caused by even the smallest typo)</em>.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why all event communications should be automated way before prime time. We always recommend planning the event communications cycle as a whole, and well ahead. Consider at least these: What should the participants know before the event? Do they need additional information about the arrangements or should they prepare in some way?</p><p><strong>Other useful ideas:</strong></p><ul><li>Especially online events and webinars are easy to forget. Haven&rsquo;t we all at least once registered for a webinar, only to notice to have forgotten it the next day&hellip; That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s good to offer a calendar link, so the participants can add the event and reminders to their own calendars. We also recommend sending a reminder message at least 15 minutes before the event. This reminder should include the webinar link and instructions on how to join.</li><li>Hybrid event communications should always be targeted based on the participation type. Live event participants will most likely want to know the arrival instructions at least one day before, online participants on the other hand are usually happy with receiving the webinar stream links on the event day. Here you&rsquo;ll find more tips for hybrid event communications.&nbsp;</li><li>You can also target automated reminder and information messaging based on the registration form field choices. For example, try sending out recommendations about accommodation options nearby to those who chose &ldquo;I need accommodation at the venue&rdquo; when registering.</li></ul><h3><a name="5"></a>5.&nbsp;Communications during the event</h3><p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s necessary to communicate to the audience also during the event. If the messaging need is urgent, we recommend choosing SMS, because it usually reaches the receiver a bit faster than email.</p><p>You can also schedule marketing automation messages during the event, for both email and SMS. Try for example sending the participants additional materials about the event program in PDF form or reminding them about the upcoming speakers. When you&rsquo;ve scheduled the messages to be sent at the right time, you&rsquo;ll be able to focus on other arrangements yourself.</p><h3><a name="6"></a>6.&nbsp;Communications after the event</h3><p>You shouldn&rsquo;t forget the participants even after the event. After all, they gave you some of their valuable time by choosing to attend your event.</p><p>Communications after the event is usually wise to target based on the participation data&nbsp;&ndash; meaning if the participant actually joined the webinar or came to the venue, or if they missed it entirely.</p><p>Those who were present should receive a thank you note, and most importantly a feedback survey. When planning the survey, it&rsquo;s good to remember that even those feedback survey form fields can be used with targeting marketing automation in the future. Would you like to ask the ones who gave poor feedback about their reasonings or development suggestions later on? Or target your next event&rsquo;s marketing for those who said they were interested to participate in the future too? You can also set up an alert from very poor feedback, giving you a chance to notice it and react in time.</p><p>However, you shouldn&rsquo;t forget those who registered but never showed up at the event. Especially online events and webinars are often followed up with an event recording, and that&rsquo;s why many also expect to get the recording afterwards by only registering. And when it comes to future events, this audience is also a delicious one to target to.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="" height="632" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/efficient-event-communications-with-marketing-automation/cache/marketing-automation-in-hybrid-and-online-events-automation-reminder-message-eng-579x632.png" width="579" /></p><p>But how to get the participation data to a marketing automation software? Webinar integration with an event management software makes it possible to follow participation data and this way also target the messages based on the participant&rsquo;s presence. Hybrid event live participation on the other hand can be tracked for example by scanning QR-coded tickets.</p><h2>Efficient event management with Eventilla</h2><p>Eventilla is an event management tool that makes it possible to create brand-like landing pages, registration processes, reports, communications, and surveys. The event process is always designed to follow the event organizer&rsquo;s own brand, which makes the event a seamless part of other marketing activities. Eventilla suits well for both hybrid and online events, because it allows targeting messages and versatile integrations.</p><p>Eventilla integrates with Liana&reg;Cloud tools such as Liana&reg;Cloud Marketing Automation and can be used in the same UI.</p><p>Interested to know more about efficient event communications and event management?

		<title>7 Tips for Using Call-to-Actions [infographic]</title>
		<link>https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/7-tips-for-using-call-to-actions-infographic.html</link>
		<description>Increase the CTRs of your newsletters, boost the sales of your online store, or improve the conversion rate of your website by designing and utilizing effective CTAs. Read these 7 tips and check out the infographic at the end of the blog post.</description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How can you increase the click-through rates of your&nbsp;newsletters, boost the sales of your&nbsp;online store, or improve the conversion rate of your website? In other words, how do you accomplish the main goals of these channels?</p><p>A <strong>Call-to-Action</strong> (CTA) is used to make a reader perform a desired action that fulfills the main goal of the marketing content or channel in question. Some examples of CTAs are the <em>Buy now</em> buttons on online stores, or <em>Learn more</em> links on articles or newsletters.&nbsp;</p><p>In the digital marketing context, they are often referred to as Call-to-Action buttons, as they tend to be designed to stand out from the rest of the content. The button is usually clearly visible, and it often has an attention-grabbing teaser text.&nbsp;</p><p>What are the main issues to consider when using and fine-tuning Call-to-Actions? Read these 7 tips and check out the infographic at the end of this blog post.</p><h2>1. Design for a specific context</h2><p>Where will you be placing your Call-to-Action? Whether it is a newsletter, an ad, a landing page or an online store, the CTAs might have different requirements for different channels. It is therefore important to design your CTA button to really stand out from the rest of the content.&nbsp;</p><p>For newsletters, the consistency between your CTA copy and the introduction text might impact your CTA&rsquo;s efficiency a lot. For online stores, on the other hand, the most crucial factor might be the clear visual design of the button, as the products on a website are often surrounded by images, descriptions and other elements.</p><p>Always consider the specific context when designing your Call-to-Action.</p><p><img alt="" height="423" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/7-tips-for-using-call-to-actions/neil_patel_example.png" width="750" /></p><p class="small"><em><a href="https://neilpatel.com/" target="_blank">Neil Patel</a> encourages website visitors to leave their digital footprints. The visitor&rsquo;s location is used in the teaser text to make it appeal to the reader.</em></p><h2>2. Optimize for various devices</h2><p>According to <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet" target="_blank">Statcounter</a>, mobile users make up over half of all internet traffic today. Make sure that your Call-to-Action is optimized for different end devices, such as smartphones, tablets, or desktop computers.</p><p>Use a responsive design for your newsletters and websites, so that your CTA looks good regardless of the device. Make sure that the button fits screens of different sizes, while preferably keeping the design the same.</p><p><img alt="" height="469" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/7-tips-for-using-call-to-actions/liana_frontpage_example.jpg" width="800" /></p><p class="small"><em><a href="https://www.lianatech.com/" target="_blank">Our website</a> is optimized for both desktop and mobile users.</em></p><h2>3. Different Call-to-Actions for different purposes</h2><p>Think about the following: what is the primary goal you want to achieve with your CTA in this particular context? Is its aim to increase your blog&rsquo;s traffic, nurture a lead on the buyer&rsquo;s journey, or perhaps get feedback on a product or a service?</p><p>Your Call-to-Actions might be very different depending on their purpose. In many cases, you might want to steer away from the most generic ones, such as Learn more.</p><p>In this video, our Marketing Specialist Elena shows examples of how <a href="https://trello.com/en" target="_blank">Trello</a> uses unique Call-to-Actions in their newsletters, at 2:40.</p><div class="embeddedContent oembed-provider-youtube" data-align="none" data-oembed="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UQj4ULBh9A" data-oembed_provider="youtube" data-resizetype="noresize"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" frameborder="0" height="349" scrolling="no" src="https://www.lianatech.com//www.youtube.com/embed/9UQj4ULBh9A?wmode=transparent&amp;jqoemcache=JkblB" width="425"></iframe></div><h2>4. Understand your audience</h2><p>Who are the people you want to get a reaction from? What would make them perform the desired action?</p><p>Offer incentives such as quality content for the reader and get creative. Depending on your target audience and tone of voice, sometimes a bit of humor might do the trick, for instance.</p><p><img alt="" height="730" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/7-tips-for-using-call-to-actions/reallygoodemails_example.png" width="720" /></p><p class="small"><em><a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/" target="_blank">Really Good Emails</a> uses a funny CTA in their newsletter that appeals to their target audience.</em></p><p>Utilizing <strong>personalization</strong> in your CTAs can make them more effective. Today&#39;s technology offers many kinds of opportunities for <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/marketing-automation/overview.html" target="_blank">marketing automation and triggered communication</a>. With the help of technology, you can have different Call-to-Actions depending on which channel the person came from, and what their action was prior to seeing your CTA.</p><p><img alt="" height="875" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/7-tips-for-using-call-to-actions/cache/spotify_cta_example-450x875.png" width="450" /></p><p class="small"><em><a href="https://www.spotify.com/" target="_blank">Spotify</a> utilizes personalization in their yearly Wrapped recaps. It tells individual users their favorite artists and songs of the year, as well as the time they spent listening to music in minutes. The users are encouraged to share their listening statistics with their social media networks.</em></p><h2>5. Brief and noticeable CTAs</h2><p>Keeping your Call-to-Action short and precise often works better than making it overly complicated. This also tends to make the visual design more clear, and allows you to fit the button on a single row.</p><p>Make your CTA stand&nbsp;out, but not to the point of irritation &ndash; there&rsquo;s no need to add flashing lights or ten exclamation marks. However, we do recommend you pay close attention to the colors and design as well as the surroundings of your button.</p><p>Does it pop out enough or are there too many distractions elsewhere on the site? Do the surrounding elements such as products description and images support the CTA?</p><p>In addition, give careful consideration to the placement of the CTA. Many readers tend to only quickly browse through&nbsp;the upper parts of a newsletter or a website. Because of this, your CTA should be placed high enough on the email or webpage.</p><p>You can run a heatmap analysis of your website or landing page to find the best placement for your CTA. This can be done, for example, with <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/" target="_blank">Hotjar</a> or <a href="https://vwo.com/v2/" target="_blank">VWO</a>.</p><p>We use the heatmap feature of our <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/email-marketing/overview.html" target="_blank">email marketing tool LianaMailer</a> for our newsletters to find out which links get clicked the most. The tool allows you to assess whether your CTA is clear enough, or if it seems to get lost between the other elements of the newsletter.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="" height="718" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/7-tips-for-using-call-to-actions/heatmap_example_en.png" width="531" /></p><p class="small"><em><a href="https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/email-marketing/overview.html" target="_blank">LianaMailer&rsquo;s heatmap feature</a> shows us which elements of our newsletter have been clicked the most.</em></p><h2>6. Consider a secondary CTA</h2><p>Performing the desired action suggested by the CTA may be too big a leap for some readers. Sometimes the main Call-to-Action can be accompanied by a secondary CTA, such as a <em>See more reviews</em> button next to an <em>Order now</em> button. The secondary CTA button is often designed in a way that separates it from the main CTA by using different graphics or colors.</p><p>You should also reintroduce the main Call-to-Action later on to those readers who chose to click on the secondary option. This way you may convince your leads to perform the desired action such as making a purchase after all, instead of bouncing off your website.</p><p><img alt="" height="404" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/7-tips-for-using-call-to-actions/cache/apple_cta_example-750x404.png" width="750" /></p><p class="small"><em><a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple</a> uses two CTAs when presenting new products on their website. Many consumers won&rsquo;t make big purchases without having detailed information about the product in question, which is why the visitor is offered the CTA </em>Learn more<em> prior to the </em>Buy button<em>.</em></p><h2>7. Analyze and double-check the path</h2><p>When you&rsquo;re assessing the effectiveness of your Call-to-Action, it&rsquo;s important to consider the path that leads to it. What were the reader&rsquo;s actions prior to seeing the CTA? Is the path tempting enough to make your target audience actually perform the desired action?</p><p>What happens after the CTA button is clicked: does its color change or will the reader be directed to a new landing page, for example?</p><p>You must look at the big picture and consider your digital marketing and its channels holistically. For instance, if you utilize a CTA in your newsletter, such as a link to an article, is your website up-to-date and functional? Does the purchase process flow effortlessly in your online store?</p><p>The Behavior Flow feature on <a href="http://analytics.google.com" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> is a great tool for assessing your website users&rsquo; path. Even a well-made Call-to-Action won&#39;t be useful if technical issues or any other kinds of inconsistencies emerge along the way.</p><h3>Measure and analyze your results</h3><p>Get the most out of your digital marketing by measuring and analyzing the performance of your CTAs. Try different word choices, visual elements, and placements and make adjustments based on real data. This allows you to improve your communications and digital marketing.</p><p><img alt="" height="1706" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/7-tips-for-using-call-to-actions/cta-article-infographic-eng-750.jpg" width="750" /></p><p class="box">In order to create attention-grabbing CTAs, you need modern marketing and communication tools.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-customer-experience/#what-is-customer-experience-management-cxm" target="_blank">53% of shoppers</a> say that they have stopped buying from an online store because of a bad experience or that a competitor offered a better one?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The problem boils down to one thing &ndash; the lack of understanding of customer experience (CX) in eCommerce.</p><p>It&rsquo;s now easier than ever to start your own online business. However, just launching your own store isn&rsquo;t enough. To make sure people know about you and keep coming back to your store, there needs to be efforts put into making the online customer experience the best it can be.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, we tell tips and tricks on how to improve the customer experience for online shoppers.</p><ol><li><a href="#1">Make it personal</a></li><li><a href="#2">Upsell &amp; cross-sell</a></li><li><a href="#3">Reduce abandoned carts</a></li><li><a href="#4">Implement out-side-of-the-box social media marketing</a></li><li><a href="#5">Ensure mobile shopping</a></li><li><a href="#6">Let customers try on products virtually</a></li></ol><h1><a name="1"></a>1. Make it personal</h1><p>Personalization is one of the strongest factors driving customer loyalty (<a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2020/07/customer-experience-in-the-new-reality.pdf" target="_blank">KPMG</a>). It&rsquo;s clear that personalization is essential for retailers to increase customer retention.&nbsp;</p><p>Use data to understand your customers better &ndash; treat the customer as an individual and make them feel valued.</p><p>Here are some personalization touchpoints you could try:</p><ul><li>Offer personal discounts on products or services that are relevant for the customer</li><li>Recognize their location and provide info on delivery to this region</li><li>Remember customer&rsquo;s history: showcase a list of recommendations based on the items a customer has viewed and a list of recently viewed items</li><li>Communicate with customers in their native language</li><li><a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/8-tips-to-personalize-your-emails.html" target="_blank">Personalize emails</a>: a birthday compliment or an invitation to an online VIP customer event will be great icing on the cake</li></ul><p class="small"><img alt="Personalized recommendation example by Goodreads" height="688" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/international-pictures/en/news/online-customer-experience-ecommerce/cache/personalized-recommendation-example-goodreads-454x688.png" width="454" /><br /><em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/" target="_blank">Goodreads</a> sends personalized reading suggestions to their customers based on their reading history.</em></p><h1><a name="2"></a>2. Upsell &amp; cross-sell</h1><p>Offering your customers relevant products is a good way to provide a superior online experience. Make sure you don&#39;t hammer buyers with irrelevant products, but rather offer the goods that complement their shopping cart.</p><p>Create valuable offers with a clear CTA. You should also consider the frequency of your messages, as constant upsells may alienate clients.&nbsp;</p><p>By offering valuable discounts and complementary products you&rsquo;re able to tie people to your online store and become regular customers.</p><p class="small"><em><img alt="an upselling email offering complementary products" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/international-pictures/en/news/online-customer-experience-ecommerce/example-of-an-upselling-email-by-dollar-shave-club.png" /></em><br /><em><a href="https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/" target="_blank">Dollar Shave Club</a> does it right: this confirmation email not only lets you know about an upcoming shipment but also upsells other products.</em></p><h1><a name="3"></a>3. Reduce abandoned carts</h1><p>Did you know in general as many as <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/457078/category-cart-abandonment-rate-worldwide/" target="_blank">88% of online shopping carts</a> were abandoned across all industries worldwide?&nbsp;</p><p>To increase eCommerce sales you need to learn what are the obstacles for people to not buy from your store. Does your checkout form fail to build trust? Or perhaps your return policy is not satisfactory enough?</p><p>Make sure you offer multiple payment options. Let your customers decide how and when they want to receive their packages. The popularity of home delivery and contactless pickup has increased over the past year.</p><p>Sometimes people just forget about their shopping carts. Send a link directing a buyer back to the shopping cart as <a href="https://society6.com/" target="_blank">Society6</a> did in this example. They also added a discount code to make sure abandoned shopping carts convert to sales 💰</p><p class="small"><img alt="Abandoned shopping cart reminder by Society6" height="827" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/international-pictures/en/news/online-customer-experience-ecommerce/cache/abandoned-shopping-cart-reminder-example-society6-454x827.png" width="454" /></p><h1><a name="4"></a>4. Implement out-of-the-box social media marketing</h1><p>There are several ways to integrate your online store with social media you might not have thought of.</p><h2>Offer shopping inside social media platforms</h2><p>At the moment it feels like almost all social media platforms are putting efforts into in-platform eCommerce solutions or building integrations to other eCommerce platforms. For example, <a href="https://www.ray-ban.com/" target="_blank">Ray-Ban</a> sells its products also on Instagram Shops.</p><p><img alt="Instagram Shops example by Ray-ban" height="780" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/international-pictures/en/news/online-customer-experience-ecommerce/cache/instagram-shops-example-ray-ban-454x780.png" width="454" /></p><h2>A Facebook bot assists with FAQ</h2><p>Facebook allows delivering automated messages through chatbots. Online shops now can automate their order confirmation, customer support, and even ensure upselling.</p><p class="small"><img alt="Facebook bot example by Asos" height="628" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/international-pictures/en/news/online-customer-experience-ecommerce/cache/facebook-bot-example-asos-454x628.png" width="454" /><br /><em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ASOS" target="_blank">Asos Facebook bot</a> offers assistance to customer questions related to delivery, order issues, product and stock availability, returns and refunds, payments, and technical support.</em></p><h2><strong>Monitor the trends</strong></h2><p>Looking for a way to better position and market your products? Apply a social media monitoring tool such as <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/pr-media/overview.html" target="_blank">LianaMonitor</a> to follow discussions on social channels. This will give you valuable insights into the needs and buying habits of your customers.</p><p>Also, with the help of a monitoring tool, you may effortlessly discover opinion leaders in your branch. Contact them and ask them to promote your products on social networks afterwards.</p><h1><a name="5"></a>5. Ensure mobile shopping</h1><p>Provide an opportunity to make a purchase on the go. You can design an app for your eCommerce business or make sure your store is responsive to all devices whether a user browses your online store on desktop or mobile device.&nbsp;</p><p>The most important thing is to make sure the customer experience is frictionless and works properly on any device.</p><p>Tip: Create a survey where you ask if your customers would prefer an app for online shopping. In exchange, offer a discount code or small gift for their next order and you make sure you get responses.</p><p><a name="blog-form-newsletter"></a></p><h1><a name="6"></a>6. Let consumers try on products virtually</h1><p>Imagine interpreting what an item would feel like in your hands, or look like in your home. Today it&rsquo;s possible to implement with the help of augmented reality (AR).</p><p>AR technology allows you to transform customers&#39; imagination into reality. If a customer can accurately see what their new furniture would look like in their home, they will make a purchase with more certainty and satisfaction.</p><div class="embeddedContent oembed-provider-youtube" data-align="none" data-oembed="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoSjmiVLsLU" data-oembed_provider="youtube" data-resizetype="noresize"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" frameborder="0" height="349" scrolling="no" src="https://www.lianatech.com//www.youtube.com/embed/HoSjmiVLsLU?wmode=transparent&amp;jqoemcache=8twOv" width="425"></iframe></div><p class="small"><em><a href="https://www.warbyparker.com/" target="_blank">Warby Parker</a> provides a possibility for home try-on with AR technology.</em></p><h2>More eCommerce resources:<em><strong> </strong></em></h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/the-end-of-third-party-cookies-how-to-prepare-with-digital-marketing-tools-infographic.html" target="_blank">The End of Third-party Cookies &ndash; How to Prepare with Digital Marketing Tools?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even in 2021, email marketing is considered one of the most cost-efficient digital marketing tools. Its high ROI (Return on Investment) shows that even with a relatively small investment it can significantly boost a company&rsquo;s sales.</p><p>Modern email marketing isn&rsquo;t always given the credit it deserves &ndash; some may still view it as &ldquo;old school&rdquo;, with newer digital marketing methods such as social media marketing often being in the spotlight of the conversation. However, when used to its fullest potential, email marketing can be an extremely effective method for nurturing your leads and engaging long-time customers.</p><p>So, don&rsquo;t just aimlessly spam your potential customers with individual ads or campaigns &ndash; utilize these 8 tips in your email marketing strategy:</p><ol><li><a href="#1">Build your mailing list yourself</a></li><li><a href="#2">Fight for attention with a compelling subject line</a></li><li><a href="#3">Create real value</a></li><li><a href="#4">Don&rsquo;t bore the reader</a></li><li><a href="#5">Engage by activating</a></li><li><a href="#6">Optimize, personalize, automate</a></li><li><a href="#7">Fine-tune the visual design to match your brand</a></li><li><a href="#8">Let the subscriber decide for themself</a></li></ol><h2><a name="1"></a>1. Build your mailing list yourself</h2><p><em>I don&rsquo;t remember signing up for this newsletter? How did this company even get my email address? 👀</em></p><p>This is often the reaction of a person who receives a random marketing email from a company they&rsquo;ve never heard of. They will likely either ignore the email, immediately unsubscribe from the mailing list, or move the message straight to junk mail. This can also harm your deliverability.</p><p><strong>Never buy a mailing list &ndash; always build it yourself.</strong></p><p>By buying a mailing list, you&rsquo;re essentially spending money on a bunch of non-functioning, or at least non-targeted, email addresses. The worst-case scenario is that the list you purchase isn&rsquo;t even collected legally, and you&rsquo;ll end up damaging your organization&rsquo;s reputation.</p><p>Nurturing your leads and engaging your customers is much more efficient when they have subscribed to your newsletter out of their own will. This way they&rsquo;ll receive exactly what they signed up for instead of being spammed with emails they don&rsquo;t care about.</p><h3>How can I get subscribers?</h3><p>There are various ways to gain subscribers to your newsletter. One of the most common methods is using an opt-in form. Make it visible on your website, and show it to your online store customers when they make a purchase, or to online visitors who sign up to your event or join a membership program, to name a few.</p><p>You can also lure people to your mailing list with lead magnets by offering them valuable content such as downloadable guides or discount codes, or by running a giveaway, for instance.</p><div class="alert border border-200 bg-100">Find out more about growing your own database: <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/the-end-of-third-party-cookies-how-to-prepare-with-digital-marketing-tools-infographic" target="_blank">The End of Third-party Cookies &ndash; How to Prepare with Digital Marketing Tools?&nbsp;</a></div><p>Using a double opt-in function ensures that your subscribers&rsquo; email addresses are real, as it requires them to confirm the email through a link sent to them personally. At the end of each newsletter, make sure to let the recipient know why they received the email &ndash; or in other words, how your organization got their email address.</p><p><img alt="" height="757" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how-to-engage-customers-with-email-marketing-8-tips/example-resq.png" width="701" /></p><p class="small"><em><a href="https://www.resq-club.com/" target="_blank">ResQ </a>offers its customers personal referral codes, which they can use to gain discount codes for both their friends and themselves. The new users are added to their mailing list.</em></p><h2><a name="2"></a>2. Fight for attention with a compelling subject line</h2><p>Many people read their emails on mobile devices. According to <a href="https://www.emailmonday.com/mobile-email-usage-statistics/" target="_blank">eMailmonday,</a> depending on factors such as your target audience, the amount of mobile email users can be as high as 78%. It&rsquo;s therefore very likely that you&rsquo;re fighting for the recipient&rsquo;s attention with a flood of notifications.</p><p>Which one would you click on first: new Instagram likes, a Facebook post, a message from a friend, a tweet posted by your favorite public figure, or an email from a company?</p><p><strong>It&rsquo;s a jungle out there: the competition of a potential customer&rsquo;s attention is tough.</strong></p><p>Focus on creating attention-grabbing subject lines: this is a crucial part of the engagement process. The headline alone must communicate the value brought by the newsletter, and compel the recipient to open and read it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/email-marketing/overview.html" target="_blank">A/B testing</a> allows you to assess what kind of subject lines work for your target audience. The function allows you to send two different versions of the newsletter to a small percentage of your mailing list, and to finally choose the headline that performed better for the rest of the recipients.</p><p>Pay attention to the length of the subject line as well. On many devices, only the first few words fit the screen. Because of this, prefer shorter subject lines of about five to seven words.</p><div class="alert border border-200 bg-100">Delve deeper into the topic: <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/how-do-i-write-a-good-subject-line.html" target="_blank">How Do I Write a Good Subject Line?</a></div><p class="small"><img alt="" height="1205" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how-to-engage-customers-with-email-marketing-8-tips/example-gymshark.png" width="700" /></p><p class="small"><em><a href="https://www.gymshark.com/" target="_blank">Gymshark</a>&rsquo;s subject line </em>So&hellip; what will we talk about? <em>draws the reader&rsquo;s attention. By asking their subscribers what topics they&rsquo;re interested in, the company is able to provide them with more valuable content.</em></p><h2><a name="3"></a>3. Create real value</h2><p>Make sure that each newsletter brings value to the subscribers. The email can bring concrete benefits to the receiver, such as:</p><ul><li>Tips or a guide</li><li>A personal offer or a discount code</li><li>Personalized content, such as an article picked specifically for the individual based on their previously read content</li><li>A reminder</li><li>An invite to an event</li></ul><p><img alt="" class="shadow-image" height="850" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how-to-engage-customers-with-email-marketing-8-tips/example-linkedin.png" width="574" /></p><p class="small"><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/liana-technologies" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> offers free personalized courses for its users in their newsletters. The reader has to act fast if they want to access the courses, as they&rsquo;re only available for a limited time.</em></p><p>Value can also be created by evoking emotions or by creating a positive image of the organization. This will strengthen the organization&rsquo;s brand image and help with the long-term engagement process of your customers. Examples of this would be thank you and welcome letters, or showing the customer you value their opinion by asking for their feedback.</p><h2><a name="4"></a>4. Don&rsquo;t bore the reader</h2><p>Especially when it comes to social media, there&rsquo;s a clear trend regarding the length of content: both texts and videos are getting shorter.&nbsp;</p><p>It is true that <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/blog-seo-17-tips-to-make-your-blog-rank-higher-on-google-with-real-examples.html" target="_blank">longer content of about 1 200 words tends to perform better when it comes to online search results</a>. However, when we&rsquo;re aimlessly browsing our phones, we tend to prefer short Instagram captions or 280 character tweets over longer articles.</p><p>The same applies to the video content: Instagram Stories or Reels that only last for a couple of seconds are increasing in popularity, as they&rsquo;re easier to watch than 10 minutes long videos.</p><p>Keep this in mind when you&rsquo;re designing your newsletters: <strong>don&rsquo;t bore your subscribers or scare them away by including too much text.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Unless we&rsquo;re specifically looking for certain information, we often tend to opt for easy-to-consume content that doesn&rsquo;t challenge our attention span for too long. If the newsletter seems too time-consuming and hard to read during a coffee break, for instance, many receivers are likely going to skip reading it.</p><p>Your newsletter should therefore be brief enough to maintain the receiver&rsquo;s interest and attention. Lure the reader in with light, easy-to-approach content, and direct them to your longer main content such as articles, landing pages, or online stores, with links. Don&rsquo;t include too much information in the newsletter itself.</p><h2><a name="5"></a>5. Engage by activating</h2><p>Once you have managed to get the reader to open your email and to quickly scan through the upper part of the letter, it&rsquo;s time to encourage them to take action.</p><p>This is perhaps one of the most important steps in the engagement process, as directing the reader to an online store, a landing page or to some action will help nurture your leads into customers.</p><p>The easiest way to activate your newsletter readers is by using a <strong>Call-to-Action (CTA) button</strong>. It can be, for instance:</p><ul><li>Browse New Products</li><li>Continue Reading</li><li>Download the Guide</li><li>Rate Us (perhaps a star rating that the reader can easily click on?)</li></ul><p>The CTA must be visually clear and easy to understand. It must be designed in a way that makes it stand out from the rest of the content. It must also be placed high enough on the letter so that the readers who only quickly scan through the message will see it before exiting.</p><h2><a name="6"></a>6. Optimize, personalize, automate</h2><p>The great thing about digital marketing is that clicking the links on newsletters and websites leaves a digital trail that can be very beneficial to a company. Essentially everything can be measured one way or another, and marketers can and should utilize the collected data in their email marketing.</p><p>Focusing on the marketing efforts that bring results and tweaking the ones that don&rsquo;t perform as well will help you <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/know-the-value-of-your-marketing-actions-the-basics-of-roi.html" target="_blank">improve the ROI of your marketing</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Collecting data allows you to <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/8-tips-to-personalize-your-emails.html" target="_blank">personalize your emails</a>. Newsletter&nbsp;subscribers can, for instance, be recommended informative articles on a topic they&rsquo;re interested in, or help them find a product with the specific features they&rsquo;re looking for.</p><p>Additionally, if the customer has allowed their name to be saved during a purchase or in an opt-in form, including their name in the newsletter may be a nice additional touch.</p><p>By segmenting their mailing list, a company can target specific messages to recipients of certain criteria. The segments can be categorized based on their previous actions such as purchases, or demographic factors such as age, for example. This way newsletters can be tailored for a specific target audience.</p><p>The collected data can also be used in automation, which tends to go hand in hand with email marketing. Specific actions can be set to trigger an automated email, such as a shopping cart reminder in online stores or a thank you letter after a purchase or an event. By utilizing data, the messages can be sent at the right time either as individual messages or drip campaigns to effectively engage the customer.&nbsp;</p><h2><a name="7"></a>7. Fine-tune the visual design to match your brand&nbsp;</h2><p>Brand continuity is key: how do you want to communicate your brand in your newsletters?</p><p><strong>Follow your brand guidelines in the designs of your emails and landing pages.</strong> Small details such as linguistic or visual choices may not feel too important, but they can significantly impact your Click-through rates and how your customers view your brand.&nbsp;</p><p>Increasing your brand recognition can directly impact customer loyalty and help to engage single-time purchasers into loyal regular customers.</p><p>An aesthetically pleasing design will help to maintain the reader&rsquo;s interest. Use visual elements such as images, videos, infographics, and various layout options in your newsletters.&nbsp;</p><p>In this video, our Designer Edi and Communications Manager Fanni discuss newsletter design trends for 2021 &ndash; in case you need inspiration.</p><div class="embeddedContent oembed-provider-youtube" data-align="none" data-oembed="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEjMCDQOfeY" data-oembed_provider="youtube" data-resizetype="noresize"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" frameborder="0" height="349" scrolling="no" src="https://www.lianatech.com//www.youtube.com/embed/dEjMCDQOfeY?wmode=transparent&amp;jqoemcache=fM6k5" width="425"></iframe></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By testing different layout and style options you can find out, what kind of elements work the best for your audience. We use LianaMailer&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/email-marketing/overview.html" target="_blank">heatmap feature</a> to see which elements on our newsletters are clicked the most.</p><h2><a name="8"></a>8. Let the subscriber decide for themself</h2><p>After completing all of the previous steps, you have to find an optimal frequency for sending your newsletters. A newsletter sent too often may be considered spam &ndash; but at the same time, you also want to make sure you&rsquo;re sending enough emails to help you with the engaging process.</p><p>Consider tailoring the number of letters for your customers&rsquo; individual needs by letting them choose for themselves in the opt-in form. Ask them, whether they want to receive an email from you daily, weekly, or monthly, for instance, and what kind of content they would like to see from you.</p><p>For instance, a person reading an online newspaper may want to receive a compilation of news related to a specific field, such as business and economics, every morning. Another reader of the same magazine will want a recap of the most important headlines across all fields once a week.</p><p>The same can apply to an online store as well: a person interested in a specific field, such as technology or fashion, may want to receive information on the latest products once a week, whereas an occasional shopper may want a similar newsletter only once a month.</p><p>When the content specifically meets the customer&rsquo;s needs, activating them becomes much easier. A reader of a magazine will click on the articles they&rsquo;re interested in, and an online shopper will benefit from the offers that are sent to them at a convenient time.</p><p><img alt="" height="806" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how-to-engage-customers-with-email-marketing-8-tips/example-nytimes.png" width="994" /></p><p class="small"><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters" target="_blank">The New York Times</a> has created tens of different newsletters for their readers. The subscriber can choose both the frequency and the topic of the content they want to receive.</em></p><h3>If they want to leave, let them go</h3><p>Unsubscribing from a mailing list should also be easy for the reader with a simple link in the newsletter. Don&rsquo;t try to trick your subscribers into staying with you by making the process complicated. Here&rsquo;s why:</p><ol><li>A mailing list full of inactive contacts will be of no use to you.</li><li>User-friendliness is a value in itself &ndash; if unsubscribing is&nbsp;difficult, it will only make your company and&nbsp;website look bad.</li><li>If unsubscribing isn&rsquo;t easy enough, many people may simply move the emails to their junk folder. This can impact the deliverability of your newsletters.</li></ol><h2>Want to learn more about digital marketing and communications?</h2><p><a name="blog-form-newsletter"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

First-party cookies also allow website owners to collect analytics data.&nbsp;</p><p>The use of first-party cookies can be declined by the website visitor, but doing so might make the user experience poor.</p><p><strong>Third-party cookies</strong> are cookies set by a website other than the one you are currently visiting, via using targeting pixels or similar techniques. Third-party cookies are utilized to track consumer behavior online: for example, to track visitors between websites and to show more relevant ads to them. This makes third-party cookies powerful marketing tools.</p><p>Many browsers, like <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/10218/full-third-party-cookie-blocking-and-more/" target="_blank">Safari</a>, are now blocking third-party cookies by default. In <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/disable-third-party-cookies" target="_blank">Firefox</a>, cross-site tracking cookies are blocked by default. The website visitor can also decline the use of third-party cookies by themselves. By doing so, the ads and content shown to the person might not be that relevant anymore.</p><p>A simple way to tell the difference between these cookie types: if the cookie is associated with the domain you are visiting, it&rsquo;s a 1st party cookie. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s a 3rd party cookie.</p><h1><a name="2"></a>What changes are coming to third-party cookies?</h1><p>With the passage of <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/tags.html?tagged=GDPR" target="_blank">GDPR</a> and other similar regulations, the privacy rights of website users are protected carefully.</p><p>Websites now need to openly share information about what customer data is collected, stored and shared forward. This has put pressure on many operators in the tech industry and pushed decision-making towards the current situation.</p><p>Some browsers, like Safari and Mozilla Firefox, have already stopped supporting third-party cookies. A year ago, in January 2020, <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html" target="_blank">Google also announced</a> that it will phase out third-party cookies from Chrome within the next two years. Google&#39;s announcement, at the latest, is forcing marketers to think about their action plans since Google takes nearly 70% of the browser market.</p><p>The big players of the field are the ones who get the most out of the new situation. For example Google, Amazon and Facebook already have tons of user data in their hands, which puts them in a very different position compared to smaller companies.</p><p>Marketers have been expecting the cookie changes, but there are still many question marks in the air. Big changes can be awaited in 2021.</p><h1><a name="3"></a>What do the cookie changes mean from a marketer&rsquo;s perspective?</h1><p>It&rsquo;s important for every marketer to plan what to do after third-party cookies won&rsquo;t be dominant anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>Digital advertising has relied heavily on targeting &ndash; and targeting in its current form will soon be history. Marketers need to adjust their practices to be able to continue collecting user data and targeting ads to relevant recipients on different platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>New methods are also needed for measuring the results of advertising because it&#39;s been expressly the third-party cookies that have shown the link between ad exposure and conversion.</p><p>The upcoming changes may sound ominous at first, but they also bring good things among them. The transparency of advertising is likely to increase and the privacy of consumers will improve. In the future, user data will be collected on the basis of consent, which will likely make customers feel more secure and satisfied.</p><p>The companies to whom the customer voluntarily discloses their information will gain the leads. It is more important than ever to be able to establish a confidential relationship with the customer. The customer will more likely hand over their personal data for your use if they trust you, understand why and how you use their data and also see that this way you are improving their customer experience.</p><p>The uncertainty with third-party cookies increases the importance of first-party cookies &ndash; meaning the data you have collected, you own and manage. The companies possessing a lot of customer data will become data-rich. In the next paragraph, we give you tips on how to become data-rich on your own.</p><h1><a name="4"></a>How can I prepare for the cookie changes with digital marketing tools?</h1><p>Don&rsquo;t panic &ndash; the use of third-party cookies will end, but platforms are creating new, alternative solutions for online advertising.</p><p>While waiting for new solutions, it&rsquo;s smart to focus on the actions you can already perform on your own:</p><ul><li>Start leveraging first-party data</li><li>Build your own audience and customer database</li><li>Keep your contact list clean</li><li>Plan strategies to make the most of your contact database</li></ul><h2>Start leveraging first-party data</h2><p>Acquire tools that help you leverage first-party data more effectively. Capturing leads with <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/email-marketing/overview.html" target="_blank">email marketing</a> and <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/marketing-automation/overview.html" target="_blank">marketing automation</a> is becoming more critical, as it gets harder to reach customers by targeted advertising.</p><p>Also, take a look at the first-party data you already possess and make sure that you share it across the organization. First-party data might be found from sources you hadn&#39;t even thought about. Check your CRM, billing systems, call center and other channels that might contain customer data, and build a better understanding of your contacts.</p><h2>Grow your own database</h2><p>The data you have collected yourself and have permission to use is extremely valuable because it won&#39;t be affected by the changes made by other companies.</p><p>Here are smart techniques you can use for growing the size of your own contact database &ndash; without using third-party cookies.</p><h3>Collect contacts through landing pages</h3><p>A landing page with a form is an effective way to collect a bunch of new contacts &ndash; just make sure that you give something valuable in exchange. Maybe you could arrange a raffle, or share a downloadable guide?</p><div class="embeddedContent oembed-provider-youtube" data-align="none" data-oembed="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SuHVzMSSEb0;t=1s" data-oembed_provider="youtube" data-resizetype="noresize"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" frameborder="0" height="349" scrolling="no" src="https://www.lianatech.com//www.youtube.com/embed/SuHVzMSSEb0?wmode=transparent&amp;jqoemcache=Hk6qb" width="425"></iframe></div><p class="small"><em>In this <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/how-to-create-a-highly-converting-landing-page-in-2020-video.html" target="_blank">video</a>, Elena and Emma from Liana&rsquo;s marketing team share their best tips for highly converting landing pages.</em></p><h3>Make the most of your events</h3><p>Events &ndash; no matter if they are live or online &ndash; always attract new faces to attend. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to get contact information from as many participants as possible.</p><p>Collect contact info already in the registration phase and add the event or webinar attendees to your mailing list. Just remember to follow GDPR requirements and ask for permission to use the contact.</p><h3>Easy email subscription from websites</h3><p>Make sure that your newsletter subscription form cannot be missed on your websites. Subscription option should stand out at a glance on every single page. Also add newsletter subscription boxes to landing pages, blog articles and other content. Like this (smart, huh?):</p><p><a name="blog-form-newsletter"></a></p><h3>Lure your eCommerce customers to subscribe</h3><p>A newsletter is an essential promotion channel for eCommerce. Add the possibility of a newsletter subscription to your order form. Offer small benefits, like a discount code or special offers for those who subscribe.</p><h3>Make your crew sell the newsletter</h3><p>Best way to get new subscribers is to let people know about your newsletter.

Make sure that invalid email addresses are deleted from your list automatically. This can, for instance, mean contacts that haven&rsquo;t reacted to any of your messages during the last six months.</p><p>Using double opt-in function also secures the quality of your database.

		<title>How to Create a Great Press Release?</title>
		<link>https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/how-to-create-a-great-press-release.html</link>
		<description>You can tell when you have a great press release in your hands. It’s ready to publish as it is, succinct, easy to understand and has an interesting topic with a clearly stated core point.  A great release also has a clear and consistent structure that follows a pattern proven to be successful.</description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Press releases are a great tool to let everyone know about an event involving your company. It can be a regular statement, the launch of a product, or a new organization telling the world that they are now open for business.</p><p>In any case, for your press release to bring real visibility, you need to invest in its redaction. Build your press release with an engaging title, a summary that says it all, a thorough body, an accurate boilerplate, but also images, quotes, and stats. Without forgetting contact information.</p><p>You have all of the necessary information to fill those parts, but you&rsquo;re not sure how to articulate them? You&rsquo;re at the right place: keep reading and learn how to create a great press release!</p><h1>What should your press release be about?</h1><p>Almost any type of organization can write a press release: it can be a small company, a big corporation, an NGO, a charity, or even a municipality. Then, depending on who is writing, the subject can be very different:</p><ul><li>The launch of a new product or service</li><li>Participation in a competition or contest &ndash; and ultimately the results</li><li>A new partnership</li><li>A customer success story</li><li>Hosting an event</li><li>A company&rsquo;s rebranding process</li><li>Announcing an acquisition, or a merger</li><li>How the company is managing a crisis</li><li>A topic to gain public attention</li></ul><p>We at Liana Technologies actively publish press releases via LianaPress and our own websites. The releases have covered multiple topics: for example when we advanced to the final of the EBA (European Business Awards) in 2019, when we entered the Brazilian market last year and when results of our surveys were published for example.</p><div class="alert border border-200 bg-100">To know more about which type of press release is the most efficient, you can check our article <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/journalists-tell-what-kind-of-press-release-goes-through-in-the-media.html" target="_blank">Journalists Tell: What Kind of Press Release Goes Through in the Media?</a></div><h1>How to start the writing process of the press release?</h1><p>When you have decided what your press release will be about, it is time to actually write it. To facilitate the writing process, the structure of your press release can be separated into three parts:</p><p><img height="960" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how_to_create_a_great_press_release_2021/press-release-triangle-eng.png" width="1100" alt="" /></p><h2>1. Grab the reader&#39;s attention</h2><h3>Headline</h3><p>The headline (or title) of your press release is the most important part of it. If it is not catchy enough, your release won&rsquo;t be read. So, without neglecting the rest of your piece, you have to pay extra attention to it.</p><p>A good title is engaging, not too long, but not too short either: you have to carefully choose your words to tickle people&rsquo;s curiosity and make them open your press release. Remember though that balance is the key, so it&rsquo;s best to avoid click-bait headlines or too mysterious titles.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some headlines that caught our attention:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;<em>Shave the Date: McDonald&#39;s&reg; Is Giving Away 10,000 Free McRib Sandwiches to Fans Who Shave Their Facial Hair</em>&rdquo; - <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/en-us/our-stories/article/press-releases.mcrib-shave-the-date.html" target="_blank">McDonald&rsquo;s</a></li><li>&ldquo;<em>Novotel teams up with Disney and Pixar&rsquo;s all-new feature film &ldquo;SOUL&rdquo; for the second phase of their global collaboration with Disney and Pixar movies.</em>&rdquo; - <a href="https://press.accor.com/novotel-teams-up-with-disney-and-pixar-all-new-feature-film-soul/?lang=en" target="_blank">Novotel</a></li><li>&ldquo;<em>BlaBlaCar &amp; Voi Technology join forces to offer BlaBla Ride scooters in France</em>&rdquo; - <a href="https://blog.blablacar.com/newsroom/news-list/blablaride" target="_blank">BlaBlaCar</a></li></ul><h3>Lead</h3><p>The lead is a short paragraph including the most important elements of the press release. This is when you need the famous &ldquo;5 Ws&rdquo;: who, what, when, where, and why, to give all the relevant information in a few lines only.</p><p>You have to think that a journalist who doesn&rsquo;t have the time to read your press release will only rely on this summary, so you want to make it short but effective.</p><p>If we keep reading the aforementioned press releases, the different summaries are the following:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;<em>In honor of the nationwide return of the McRib on December 2, McDonald&rsquo;s is partnering with No-Shave November, giving people a new way to support cancer research</em>&rdquo; - <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/en-us/our-stories/article/press-releases.mcrib-shave-the-date.html" target="_blank">McDonald&rsquo;s</a></li><li>&ldquo;<em>For the first time, BlaBlaCar extended its multimodal offer into micro-mobility by joining forces with Swedish e-scooter company Voi Technology. Thanks to this strategic partnership, BlaBla Ride scooters will help French cities and their citizens have access to safe and sustainable mobility at a time when it is more crucial than ever. Both companies remain separate legal entities.</em>&rdquo; - <a href="https://blog.blablacar.com/newsroom/news-list/blablaride" target="_blank">BlaBlaCar</a></li></ul><h2>2. Delve into the subject</h2><h3>Body</h3><p>The body of your press release is the longest part in terms of content. In it, the lead is developed more thoroughly, by providing further details. Remember to communicate the most important information first, and the least important in the end.&nbsp;</p><p>When you are writing your press release, use vocabulary that is easy to understand. Using too specific terms and creating complex sentences won&rsquo;t make the reading of your piece agreeable: again, keep it simple.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s what BlaBlaCar&rsquo;s press release&rsquo;s body looks like:</p><p><img alt="" height="1127" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how_to_create_a_great_press_release_2021/body-pr-article.png" width="795" /></p><p>In the body of your press release, you can insert quotes or statistics, in order to make your piece more complete and reliable.</p><p>Also, the writing style of the press release doesn&rsquo;t need to be extremely formal. Instead, try to personalize the content a little bit, and a bold approach can help you to stand out from the crowd!</p><h2>3. Finishing touches</h2><h3>Boilerplate</h3><p>The boilerplate is one of the latter elements of your press release. This part is a short description of your company, your product, or the person that is the core subject of your release. Here you can also insert a link to your website or to a landing page regarding your product.</p><h3>Contact information</h3><p>It is vital to add the contact information of someone who can provide more details about the topic. It can be a phone number or email address, and if a journalist calls to have more information about the topic, you have to answer right away.</p><div class="Article__Quote ckeditor-template ckeditor-template-section"><div class="Article__QuoteBubble ckeditor-template-section">&quot;The contact person needs to be available for the whole press release publishing day &ndash; in the evening as well. It is beyond frustrating to try to get a hold of a contact person who doesn&rsquo;t answer. Many story details or even a whole press release haven&rsquo;t been published because of this on occasion. Because I also train PR people, I formulate it for them like this: the contact person eats, jogs, goes to the sauna, makes love, and sleeps with their phone in hand for the next 24 hours!&quot;</div><div class="Article__QuotePerson ckeditor-template-section"><div class="Article__QuoteName ckeditor-template-section">A respondent to our<a href="https://www.lianatech.com/guide-effective-pr-with-press-releases.html?utm_source=blog_article&amp;utm_medium=how_to_create_a_great_press_release" target="_blank"> international survey</a></div></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here&rsquo;s an example from <a href="https://press.accor.com/novotel-teams-up-with-disney-and-pixar-all-new-feature-film-soul/?lang=en" target="_blank">Novotel</a>, showing that you can insert information concerning your own company in the boilerplate, but also concerning the third parties mentioned in your press release:<img alt="" height="1162" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how_to_create_a_great_press_release_2021/about-novotel.png" width="1093" /></p><p>Even if you are a worldwide known company, you should add a boilerplate to your press release, just like McDonald&rsquo;s does:&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="" height="216" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how_to_create_a_great_press_release_2021/about-mcdonalds.png" width="749" /></p><p>Before sending your press release, make sure that you have all of these elements &ndash; the ideal length being one page. Don&rsquo;t forget to add the logo of your company in the beginning, so that the reader knows which company is in question.&nbsp;</p><p>You also need to insert the date of the press release above the headline. If the press release is embargoed (meaning if it is to be published on a later date), this is where you would want to give this information.</p><p>Last tip: adding images and videos to illustrate what you are saying is a really good idea, as they increase the likelihood that the press release will be published. Add all the visuals and other extra materials to your press release as links: this ensures that the quality is good and that the receiver&#39;s inbox won&#39;t jam.</p><div class="alert border border-200 bg-100">Are you looking for more tips to create a performing press release?

You can send it to journalists that will publish it on their media, but you can also publish it on newsrooms, pressrooms, on your own website, and on social media.</p><p>If you decide to share it with journalists and think that the right approach is to send it to everyone in your database to make sure that someone will publish it: we have a tip for you.&nbsp;</p><p>You need to target the journalists that will be interested in your topic, so make sure that they are experts in your field and that they will know what you&rsquo;re talking about. A journalist specialized in the food-processing industry would definitely be more interested in a piece about this field rather than about arts and crafts.</p><p>Even if your press release is not published this time doesn&rsquo;t mean that you should stop writing and sending them. It might be that the journalists are not familiar with you yet, but if you keep informing them, you might get published one day.</p><p>Are you looking for a tool to create and publish effective press releases?
